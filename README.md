Diabetes Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
Project Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on a diabetes dataset. The primary goal is to uncover insights and patterns related to diabetes prevalence, patient demographics, and other health factors. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify key trends and correlations that could aid in understanding the factors contributing to diabetes.

Dataset Description
The diabetes dataset contains features such as:
age: Age of the patient
gender: Gender of the patient
hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No)
heart_disease: Whether the patient has heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No)
smoking_history: The patient's history of smoking
bmi: Body Mass Index of the patient
HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level (a measure of blood sugar levels over time)
blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level
diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (1: Yes, 0: No)
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Perform Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, ensure data consistency, and encode categorical variables.
Explore the Dataset: Analyze relationships between different features using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Visualize Key Insights: Create meaningful visualizations that depict trends and patterns in the data.
Generate Hypotheses: Identify possible factors that correlate with diabetes and suggest potential areas for further research.
Steps and Analysis
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Addressed missing values by imputing or removing them as necessary.
Encoded categorical variables such as gender and smoking_history for analysis.
Scaled numerical features like bmi and HbA1c_level to ensure consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the distribution of key features like age, bmi, and blood_glucose_level.
Investigated the relationships between features and the target variable diabetes.
Explored how health conditions (hypertension, heart disease, smoking) are associated with diabetes prevalence.
Data Visualization

Created histograms, box plots, and bar charts to visualize distributions and outliers.
Used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
Plotted scatter plots and line charts to explore trends in age, BMI, and glucose levels among diabetic patients.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced and attractive statistical visualizations.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis.
Key Findings
Age and Diabetes: Older individuals are more likely to have diabetes, with a higher prevalence in patients aged 50 and above.
BMI and Diabetes: Higher BMI values are strongly associated with the presence of diabetes.
Blood Glucose Levels: Elevated blood glucose levels are common in diabetic patients, with a clear difference between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
Smoking and Diabetes: Patients with a history of smoking showed a higher incidence of diabetes.
