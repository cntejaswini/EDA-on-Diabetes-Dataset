# Diabetes Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on a diabetes dataset. The primary goal is to uncover insights and patterns that could aid in understanding the factors contributing to diabetes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `gender`: Gender of the patient
- `hypertension`: Hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No)
- `heart_disease`: Heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `HbA1c_level`: Measure of blood sugar levels over time
- `blood_glucose_level`: Current blood glucose level
- `diabetes`: Diabetes diagnosis (1: Yes, 0: No)

## Objectives
1. Perform data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis to understand key trends and relationships.
3. Visualize findings using various graphs and charts.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Key Findings
- Older individuals are more likely to have diabetes, especially those over the age of 50.
- Higher BMI is associated with a higher likelihood of diabetes.
- Patients with a history of smoking had a higher incidence of diabetes.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-eda.git
